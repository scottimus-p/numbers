# numbers

## Description ##

This is a simple web app that converts signed and unsigned integers into their binary representation.

## Dependencies ##

None. The app is written entirely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Any modern browser should be able to execute the JavaScript and render the HTML and CSS.

## Future Enhancements ##

Some possible future enhancements I could make:

* Text formatting - format the binary and hexadecimal sections so that bytes are separated by spaces improve readability (e.g. `12ef` in hex would be displayed as `12 ef`)
* Floating point numbers - do similar conversions for floating point numbers using the IEEE 754 standard
